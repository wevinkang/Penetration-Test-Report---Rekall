# Penetration Test Report - Rekall

Penetration Testing Capture the Flag (CTF) in which I worked in a team of six to discover, exploit, and report web application, Linux servers, and Windows
servers vulnerabilities of an organization in Windows Azure Lab services. Once completed, a pentesting report was drafted documenting all findings and 
vulnerabilities.

This project revolved around the OWASP Top 10 Web Application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc. and used security 
tools in Kali Linux such as OSINT tools, Nmap, Metasploit/Meterpreter, and others following the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
